There’s nothing left.
I am Stephen’s complete indifference.
Where have all the feelings gone?
My soul burns black.
I can’t find my shoe… oh wait… I don’t have any shoes.-_-
Hello, moon, my lonely friend
Does the darkness speak to you as well?
Do tears cure me from myself?
Someone just end it.
The dog likes my droppings more than me.
Why do I seek validation from a dog?
Cat be sad.
Where put sadness?
If it can’t fit… does it not sit?
I Sorry I push things…
Where is Stephen’s home?
How am I so, so lost?
Is I human slave?
My life go nowhere.
I miss yarn ball, but yarn ball no miss me.
Sigh.
yawn.
Why sleep all day? Who cares…
Nine lives? One is too much…
Where is the mouse? I need friend. I ate mouse, I have no friend.
Why is I Stephen? Who was Stephen first?
